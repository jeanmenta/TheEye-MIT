# Eye Exercise

This project showcases an interactive eye movement animation, where a pair of eyes follow the user's cursor as it moves across the screen, creating a dynamic and engaging visual effect.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Move your mouse cursor across the screen and observe the eyes following the cursor movement.

## Roadmap of future improvements
- Enhance the eye animation with more realistic eye textures and features.
- Add options for users to customize the appearance of the eyes, such as eye color, shape, and size.
- Implement a smoother eye movement animation that mimics natural eye motion.
